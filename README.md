# Advanced Video Querying System for Machine Learning
An advanced video querying system designed for machine learning applications, enabling complex temporal and spatial searches within large video datasets. The system integrates state-of-the-art object detection and tracking technologies to efficiently filter and retrieve specific video segments required for AI model training.

## Key Features:
Precise Temporal & Spatial Queries: Search for moments within specific time intervals and spatial areas in videos.
Complex Object Interaction Detection: Query based on object interactions (e.g., proximity or shared scenes).
Efficient Data Filtering: Extracts exactly whatâ€™s needed for AI model training, optimizing resources.

## Technologies:
TransVOD++ for object detection
MongoDB for scalable metadata storage
FFmpeg for video processing
R-trees for efficient indexing

## Future Work:
Integration of action recognition models
Real-time video stream support
